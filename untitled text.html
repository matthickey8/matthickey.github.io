<p><font color="red">Hello there, Welcome to my website! I am a third year Business Management student from North Berwick, ME.</p>

<p><font color="red">My interests include kayaking, hiking, water sports, photography, playing 2k, and pretty much anything sports related.</p>
<p><font color="red">I'm pretty interested in learning about HTML & info systems. With technology and the internet playing such a big role in the world we live in today and in the business world learning about info systems and using HTML it will help me advance in my career field. Below is a video showing why I love going to school here at the University of Maine and link to the business school for the University.   </p>
